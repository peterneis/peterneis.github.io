I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the Toulouse School of Economics and am on the 2022/2023 Job Market.

My research interest are focused around **Development Economics**, **Law & Economics** and **Applied Microeconometrics**.

I am interested in understanding how judiciaries around the world (but mainly in India) influence (economic) development.
