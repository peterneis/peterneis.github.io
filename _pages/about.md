I am a postdoctoral researcher in economics at the the Centre d’Etudes et de Recherches sur le Développement International (CERDI).

My research interests are focused on **Development Economics**, **Law & Economics** and **Applied Microeconometrics**.

Broadly, I am interested in understanding how judiciaries around the world (with a particular focus on India) influence (economic) development.

Specifically, I am fascinated by questions related to the role of the judicial system in societies. How do formal and informal legal institutions interact? What is the interplay between judicial systems and other branches of government? Can the judicial system fill the void left by inactive legislators on many topics? And how does this impact development?
