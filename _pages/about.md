I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the Toulouse School of Economics and am on the 2022/2023 Job Market.

My research interest are focused around **Development Economics**, **Law & Economics** and **Applied Microeconometrics**.

I am interested in understanding how judiciaries around the world (but mainly in India) influence (economic) development.

In my [Job Market Paper](../files/Neis_Peter_JMP.pdf), I study how judicial efficiency can affect firmsâ€™ decisions to become formal and to hire formal workers. I propose a model to study the impact of court efficiency on informality decisions and then use a combination of Indian datasets to estimate these impacts empirically.
