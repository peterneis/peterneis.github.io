I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the Toulouse School of Economics and will join the Centre d'Etudes et de Recherches sur le DÃ©veloppement International (CERDI) this fall.

My research interest are focused around **Development Economics**, **Law & Economics** and **Applied Microeconometrics**.

Broadly, I am interested in understanding how judiciaries around the world (but mainly in India) influence (economic) development.

Especically, I am fascinated by questions related to the role of the judicial system in societies. Wow do formal and informal legal institutions interact? How does the interplay between judicial systems and other legislators / government work? Can the judicial system fill the void left by inactive legislators on many topics? And how does this impact development?
