I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the Toulouse School of Economics.

I am on the Job Market in 2022/2023.

My research interest are *Development Economics*, *Law & Economics* and *Applied Microeconomics*.

I am interested in understanding how judiciaries around the world (but mainly in India) influence (economic) development.
