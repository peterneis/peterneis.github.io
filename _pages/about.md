I'm a postdoctoral researcher in economics at the **Centre d’Etudes et de Recherches sur le Développement International (CERDI)**. I hold a PhD **from the Toulouse School of Economics** and have held visiting researcher positions at the Department of Economics at the **University of Zurich** (2022) and the McCourt School of Public Policy at **Georgetown University** (2024/25).

My research focuses on the intersetion of **Development Economics**, **Law & Economics**, **Environmental Economics** and **Applied Microeconometrics**. I'm particularly interested in how judicial systems, with a focus on India, influence economic development. Specifically, my work explores the interaction between formal and informal legal institutions, the interplay between the judiciary and other government branches, and the capacity of courts to address issues left unaddressed by legislators.
