## [Courts, Firms, and Informality (Job Market Paper)](../files/Neis_Peter_JMP.pdf)
Ulyssea (2018) estimated a structural model looking at the intensive (formal firms hiring informal workers) and extensive (firms becoming informal) margins of informality. Other authors suggest higher court productivity (less congestion, faster disposals) leads to more bank credits, better contract enforcement, property rights, etc. The paper discusses the extensive and intensive margin impacts when court productivity increases in the specific case of India. In theory, these different channels could lead to more formal firms (due to better contract enforcement, access to finance, etc) with more informal workers (formal workers more likely to go to court).



## [Litigation as Scrutiny: A Four Decade Analysis of Environmental Justice, Firms, and Pollution in India](../files/Bhupatiraju_et-al_2024_Litigation-as-scrutiny.pdf)

This study investigates the impact of judicial enforcement on environmental outcomes in India, using a unique dataset spanning four decades that includes court cases, pollution data, corporate finances, and infant mortality rates. Leveraging the quasi-random assignment of cases to judges and their writing styles, we find evidence consistent with litigation as scrutiny. Findings show that environmental litigation leads to temporary reductions in pollution and affects firm performance during legal proceedings. However, pollution levels rebound post-litigation, with no significant effect at anytime on infant mortality. This highlights the limited efficacy of judicial environmental interventions in highly polluted contexts like India.



## [Impact of free legal search on rule of law: evidence from Indian Kanoon](../files/Draft_Indian_Kanoon_2022.pdf)
(*with S. Bhupatiraju, D. L. Chen, R. Das & S. Joshi*)  
Access to legal information is limited in many parts of the world. Can digital platforms offering free legal search reduce market-level constraints on economic development? We explore this question by estimating the impact of India's Kanoon, a free legal search engine on cases, courts and firms. We use a simple event study framework that exploits the staggered rollout of the platform across different states. We find a variety of impacts. In the high courts, Kanoon is associated with a 1--2\% increased likelihood of case resolutions and an over 20\% decline in case backlog. In the district courts, the number of filings decreases during the first two years after the rollout. Cases that are appealed from the district courts are also more likely to be disposed and overturned in the years after the launch. Kanoon also appears to affect the finances of firms with positive impacts on assets and negative impacts on audit fees and bad debts. These results highlights the potential for open access platforms to be transformative for economic development.    


## [Who is in justice? Caste, religion and gender in the courts of Bihar over a decade](../files/Draft_Patna.pdf)
(*with S. Bhupatiraju, D. L. Chen & S. Joshi*)  [=> WB Working Paper](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/384061614260524872/pdf/Who-Is-in-Justice-Caste-Religion-and-Gender-in-the-Courts-of-Bihar-over-a-Decade.pdf)  
Bihar is widely regarded as one of India's poorest and most divided states. It has also been the site of many social movements that have left indelible marks on the state's politics and identity. Little is currently known about how structural inequalities have affected the functioning of formal systems of justice in the state. We use a novel dataset of more than 1 million cases filed at the Patna high court between 2009-2019 together with a variety of supplementary data to analyze the role of religion, caste and gender in the high court of Bihar. We find that the courts are not representative of the Bihari population. Muslims, women and scheduled castes are consistently under-represented. The practice of using "caste neutral" names is on the rise. Though there is little evidence of "matching" between either judges and petitioners or between judges and filing advocates on the basis of names, we do find evidence that petitioners and their advocates match on the basis of identity such as the use of "caste neutral" names. These results suggest that the social movements which disrupted existing social structures in the past may have inadvertently created new social categories that reinforce networks and inequalities in the formal justice system.
