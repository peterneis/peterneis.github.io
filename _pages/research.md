## Publications:
**[Caste Aside? Names, Networks and Justice in the Courts of Bihar, India](https://publicera.kb.se/ejels/article/view/23821/26260)**
(*with S. Bhupatiraju, D. L. Chen & S. Joshi*) 2024 European Journal of Empirical Legal Studies, 1(2), 151–178. https://doi.org/10.62355/ejels.23821
This study investigates the impact of social identity on judicial processes and outcomes at the Patna High Court over a decade (2009 to 2019). We employ machine learning algorithms to infer caste status from surnames (names) in court records. We note that a majority of court participants have ‘caste-neutral’ names. Though we find no evidence of name-based ‘matching’ between litigants and judges, caste-neutral petitioners are 3.3% more likely to choose a caste-neutral advocate. Matching, whether intentional or coincidental, yields notable consequences. Litigants with caste-neutral names who matched with similar judges face a higher likelihood of case dismissal and lower success rates in overturning appeals. However, advocates with caste-neutral names experience less disadvantage in these scenarios. Notably, the adoption of caste-neutral names, while offering some protection, does not fully mitigate the vulnerabilities faced by citizens within India's judicial institutions.

**[Short-term association between COVID-19 related deaths, hospitalized patients and air pollution during the first lockdown in the four largest cities in Germany](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207233.2021.2006914)**
(*with R. Walsemann*) 2024, International Journal of Environmental Studies, 80(1), 207–222. https://doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2021.2006914
Identifying risk factors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for its clinical course became important during the current global health crisis. This study explores the relationship between ambient air quality and the clinical course of COVID-19 during the first German lockdown. Daily air pollutant concentrations (PM10, O3 and NO2) and confirmed COVID-19-related hospital cases and deaths in the four largest German cities are used for multivariate regression analysis to study the correlation of air pollutants with COVID-19-related hospitalised or ICU patients and deaths. A significant positive association of O3 with patients and deaths is observed. NO2 shows a positive correlation with hospitalised and ICU patients. A 10 µg/m3 increase in O3 is linked to a 27% (95% CI: 15% to 39%) increase of COVID-19-related deaths. However, PM10 is associated with a decrease in deaths. Altogether, these findings indicate that air pollutants seem to have a significant influence on the course of COVID-19 infections.


## Working Papers

**[Impact of free legal search on rule of law: evidence from Indian Kanoon](../files/Bhupatiraju_et-al_2024_Indian_Kanoon.pdf)**
(*with S. Bhupatiraju, D. L. Chen & S. Joshi*) Revise and Resubmit Journal of the European Economic Association
This paper examines the role of digital platforms, specifically Indian Kanoon, in providing free legal search services and their impact on overcoming economic barriers at the market level. Utilizing a generalized difference-in-differences approach, our analysis reveals that the staggered rollout of Kanoon has significantly improved access to justice and court efficiency without compromising decision quality. Notably, the advent of Kanoon has instigated profound financial alterations in firms, evidenced by marked increases in assets, income, and expenditures. These effects were observed not only in litigating firms but across the wider business spectrum. Consequently, this study sheds light on the pivotal role of unrestricted access to legal information in driving economic progress.  

**[Environmental Litigation as Scrutiny: A Four Decade Analysis of Justice, Firms, and Pollution in India](../files/Bhupatiraju_et-al_2024_Litigation-as-scrutiny.pdf)**
*(with S. Bhupatiraju, D. L. Chen, S. Joshi, & S. Singh)* Submitted
This study investigates the impact of judicial enforcement on environmental outcomes in India, using a unique dataset spanning four decades that includes court cases, pollution data, corporate finances, and infant mortality rates. Leveraging the quasi-random assignment of cases to judges and their writing styles, we find evidence consistent with litigation as scrutiny. Findings show that environmental litigation leads to temporary reductions in pollution and affects firm performance during legal proceedings. However, pollution levels rebound post-litigation, with no significant effect at anytime on infant mortality. This highlights the limited efficacy of judicial environmental interventions in highly polluted contexts like India.

**[Islamophobia in the Justice System and Judicial Mitigation in Bihar, India](../files/Bhupatiraju_et-al_2024_Patna_Muslim.pdf)**
*(with S. Bhupatiraju, D. L. Chen, & S. Joshi)* Submitted
This study examines the processes and outcomes of justice for Muslim litigants over a decade (2009-2019) in Bihar’s Patna High Court. We find no evidence of in-group matching between petitioners and judges, but Muslim petitioners are 30 percentage points more likely to be represented by Muslim lawyers. Cases featuring both Muslim petitioners and lawyers are 7 percentage points less likely to be successful relative to all other cases. High Caste Hindu judges appear to eliminate these disparities. We interpret this as an effort to counteract bias against Muslims, who are under-represented as judges and lawyers. Notably, these judicial mitigation efforts diminish following the general election of 2014.

**[Courts, Firms, and Informality (Job Market Paper)](../files/Neis_Peter_JMP.pdf)**
Ulyssea (2018) estimated a structural model looking at the intensive (formal firms hiring informal workers) and extensive (firms becoming informal) margins of informality. Other authors suggest higher court productivity (less congestion, faster disposals) leads to more bank credits, better contract enforcement, property rights, etc. The paper discusses the extensive and intensive margin impacts when court productivity increases in the specific case of India. In theory, these different channels could lead to more formal firms (due to better contract enforcement, access to finance, etc) with more informal workers (formal workers more likely to go to court).
